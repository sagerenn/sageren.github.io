# Share file
When you want to share file public, maybe you just be lazy to login an account or just hide from the normal people. 
1. find an Anonymous File Sharing and Hosting Sites

    |          name           |     limit      |
    | :---------------------: | :------------: |
    | https://zippyshare.com/ | maximum 500 MB |
    |  https://transfer.sh/   |       -        |

2. upload to some hidden endpoint, like ftp, forum

However, to keep your file forever or longer, you may take another step. e.g. caching them to [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/).
